and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2024-10-31

### Changed

- The `Assembler\PostType` and `Crumb\PostType` classes both now have a `$type` property that can be set when initializing the classes. Previously, these were mismatched, and one was named `$post_type`.

### Fixed

- A call to the `Crumb\PostType` class used the wrong parameter name of `$post_type` instead of `$type`.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-10-21

### New

- **Block:** Added an option for removing the first breadcrumb.
- **Block:** Added a "Markup Style" option for selecting between plain HTML, Microdata, and RDFa (default) markup.
- Overhauled the plugin to use a more robust OOP structure that will allow it to be extended.
- Several new hooks that act as extension points for third-party developers:
	- `x3p0/breadcrumbs/environment`
	- `x3p0/breadcrumbs/builder/pre/build`
	- `x3p0/breadcrumbs/builder/config`
	- `x3p0/breadcrumbs/markup/config`

### Deprecated

- The `X3P0\Breadcrumbs\Trail` static class should no longer be used and will be removed in version 3.0.0. Instead, use the existing `Environment`, `Builder`, and `Markup` implementations to build breadcrumbs or the **Breadcrumbs** block.

### Removed

- The PHP APIs are no longer backward compatible with version 1.0.x.
- Setting the HTML structure via options is no longer supported. Instead, use a `Markup` class.

## [1.0.1] - 2023-10-25

### Changed

- Block API bumped to version 3.

### Removed

- Removed the `x3p0/breadcrumbs/trail` filter hook at the request of a reviewer for the WordPress.org Plugin Review Team.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-07-15

### Added

- ðŸŽ‰ Literally everything. This is version 1.0, after all.
